        LED CHASER
THEORY:
Take  1 breadboard, 5 LED’S, 1 Arduino board and 11 wires. Install 5  led’S in breadboard in such a way that their ‘n’ terminals  are connected and ‘p’ terminals should not be connected.By taking 5 wires connect all ‘n’ terminals  and from there take another wire and connect it to the ground of digital pins in arduino board .Now take another 5 wires  and connect  to the ‘p’ terminals of led’S such that every ‘p’ terminal contain 1 wire.Now take all the 5 wires of ‘p’ terminal and connect any 5 pins of arduino board.By using cable connect the arduino board to the computer.
LEARNING AND OBSERVATIONS:
After verifying and uploading the code that you have coded we can observe that the led’S starts glowing in such a way that if 1,2 led’S 4are ON then remaining led’s are OFF and if 2,3 led’S 4are ON then remaining led’s are OFF and
if 3,4 led’S 4are ON then remaining led’s are OFF and if 4,5 led’S 4are ON then remaining led’s are OFF and if 5,1 led’S 4are ON then remaining led’s are OFF .It starts working like this.

PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING: 
You should take care whether the board is the board is in arduino\uno or not and also selection of port in tools.This is the main problem where we get confusion
PRECAUTIONS:
While installing led’s in bread board we should take care whether the ’n’  terminals of led’s connected or not.Here the ‘n’  terminals should  be connected similarly, we should check whether the ‘p’ terminals are connected or not.In this case ‘p’ terminals should not be connected .Install the wires properly in both bread board and arduino board.
LEARNING OUTCOMES:
With this experiment we can learn that how led’s are blinking in such a way that 1,2 & 2,3 & 3,4 & 4,5 & 5,1.These are all the positions at which led’s blinks.This is the step by step process.
