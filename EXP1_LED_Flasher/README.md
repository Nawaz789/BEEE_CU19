        LED FLASHER
THEORY:
Take  1 breadboard, 1 LED, 1 Arduino board and 2 wires. Install the led in breadboard in such a way that they are not connected each other.Take 2 wires and connect 1 wire to the ‘n’ terminal of led and another wire to the ‘p’ terminal of led.Now take an arduino board and connect n terminal wire to the ground in digital pins of arduino board.Similarly, connect p terminal of wire to any one of the digital pins from 1 to 13.By using cable connect arduino board to the computer.After this step verify and upload the code that you have coded.
LEARNING AND OBSERVATIONS:
After verifying and uploading the code that you have coded we can observe that the led starts glowingand after few milliseconds it again turn off.
PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING: 
You should take care whether the board is the board is in arduino\uno or not and also selection of port in tools.This is the main problem where we get confusion
PRECAUTIONS:
While installing led in bread board we should take care whether the terminals of led connected or not.The two terminals should not be connected.Install the wires properly in both bread board and arduino board.
LEARNING OUTCOMES:
With this experiment we can learn how to blink led with the help of coading and in this experiment we are not using any battery.Arduino board provide sufficient voltage and current to the bread board and with the help of bread board led utilize voltage and current and it starts glowing.
